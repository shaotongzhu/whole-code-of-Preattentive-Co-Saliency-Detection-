# Issue about Preattentive co-saliency detection

Instruction:

1.Unzip the file 'cosal'.

2.Put AW.mat, im2Vector.m and vector2Im.m together with thoes files we unziped last step.

2.Run the file 'cosal_demo'.





When I learn about this thesis, I found out that the code or the project of it is published on the author's personal hompage


personal homepage:
http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~htchen/

However, shit happened. 

Three additional files created by  Xiaodi Hou are required for running the demo code:
    AW.mat
    im2Vector.m
    vector2Im.m
I were supposed to download the three files from Xiaodi Hou's website, which clearly has been changed due to some reasons. Therefore, those files can't be found through the given link.

I checked on so many websites that I even nearly believed that those files would never be found. Luckly, I finally found out those threee files after three houres. 


Getting in back to the point, the project is fully functional and could be run as soon as finishing downloading. 

This is my first time to upload codeï¼Œso I haven't figure out how to upload the whole folder right now. As a result, I have to upload each files separately.
