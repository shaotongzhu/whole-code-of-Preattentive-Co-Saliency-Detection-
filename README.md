# Issue about Preattentive co-saliency detection
When I learn about this thesis, I found out that the code or the project of it is published on the author's personal hompage


personal homepage:

However, shit happened. 

Three additional files created by  Xiaodi Hou are required for running the demo code:
    AW.mat
    im2Vector.m
    vector2Im.m
I were supposed to download the three files from Xiaodi Hou's website, which clearly has been changed due to some reasons. Therefore, those files can't be found through the given link.

I checked on so many websites that I even nearly believed that those files would never be found. Luckly, I finally found out those threee files after three houres. 


Getting in back to the point, the project is fully functional and could be run as soon as finishing downloading.
